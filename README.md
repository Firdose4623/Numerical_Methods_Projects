# 🧮 Numerical Methods Projects

A collection of interactive Streamlit-based applications developed as part of the Numerical Methods course at IITH. These tools demonstrate core numerical techniques such as eigenvalue computation, Gauss-Legendre integration, and solving differential equations via boundary and initial value formulations.
